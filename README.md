3) Now you're ready to start adding clients. Let your client know your `trainer code` so they can add you from their end.
4) As client's meet the criteria, the trainer will be in charge of distributing the necessary reward points to them. The trainer is also notified when I client wants to redeem a reward and can choose to approve or deny the request.

## Challenges Faced
* * *
Finding a way to connect the databases, routes, and users together proved to be a difficult task. We also needed to figure out which types of user were responsible for altering different areas of the rewards database.

## Future Development
* * *
Our plans for future development of this project is to implement more features like booking training sessions and workout plans.
